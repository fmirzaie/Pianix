# Pianix

Painix is a recurrent neural network (RNN) model designed for generating piano music note sequences and durations, mainly for educational purposes. It leverages the power of deep learning to create musical compositions autonomously, mimicking the style and patterns of input training data.

Features:

    Music Generation: Painix utilizes a deep learning architecture, specifically an RNN-based model, to generate piano music sequences. It learns from a dataset of piano music to produce new compositions.

    Note Sequences and Durations: The model generates both note sequences and durations, capturing the essence of musical timing and rhythm.

    Flexibility: Painix offers flexibility in adjusting parameters such as sequence length, temperature scaling, and model architecture, allowing users to tailor the generated music to their preferences.


## Usage Disclaimer

Painix is intended for educational and experimental purposes only. While it can generate music sequences resembling those in the training dataset, the generated compositions may vary in quality and may not always meet the expectations of professional musicians or composers. 

Users are encouraged to use Painix responsibly and to respect copyright laws when using generated music for any purpose other than personal exploration or study. Painix should not be used to generate music for commercial purposes without appropriate rights and permissions.

Furthermore, it's important to note that Painix may not always produce original or entirely novel compositions. Generated music may bear similarities to existing pieces in the training dataset or follow established musical patterns and conventions.

By using Painix, users acknowledge and accept the inherent limitations and uncertainties associated with algorithmic music generation. The developer of Painix assumes no liability for any consequences arising from the use or misuse of the software.
